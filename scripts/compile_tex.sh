# compile_tex.sh - Properly compiles .tex files
#
# This script is used to compile .tex files to .pdf files using the lualatex compiler.
# It includes all the neccessary commands to also automatically do the bibtex and nomcl compilation.
# This compiles the file tex/PROJECT/main.tex to a pdf and saves it as tex/PROJECT/output/PROJECT.pdf
# In order for it to find the correct directories, it has to be run directly from the src/scripts/ directory.
# It also automatically cleans up other files generated by the compiler, other than the PROJECT.pdf file.
#
# Usage:
# ./compile_tex.sh [OPTIONS] [PROJECT]
#
#
# Available options:
#     -k, --keep-all        Forces the script to not clean up after itself, leaving files for debugging purposes
#     -v, --verbose         Prints more information about the current state of compiling.
#     -h, --help            Show brief help
#
